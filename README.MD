# Python Data Analysis with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

## Overview
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks used for learning and practicing data analysis in Python. The primary libraries covered are:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization and plotting.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced data visualization based on Matplotlib.

The repository is based on Luke Barousse's *Python for Data Analytics* course.The dataset come from 2023, providing insights into current trends in the job market and skill demand.

Each notebook focuses on a specific topic or function within these libraries, with practical examples to enhance understanding.
